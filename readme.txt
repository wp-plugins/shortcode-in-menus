Allows you to add shortcodes in WordPress Navigation Menus

== Description ==

Allows you to add shortcodes in WordPress Navigation Menus so that you can generate links dynamically. Also allows you to add full fledged html sections to navigation menus.

> *Note*
> 
> This new version adds a *Shortcode* box on the Nav Menus screen. The earlier functionality using the *Links* box will be deprecated over the next few versions. Please switch to this new box, asap.

**Usage**
